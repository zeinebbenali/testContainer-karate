In this guide, you will learn how to

* Create a Spring Boot application
* Implement a REST API endpoint using Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, and Postgres
* Test REST API using Testcontainers and RestAssured.

== Prerequisites
* Java 17+
* Your favorite IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code)
* A Docker environment supported by Testcontainers https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/

== What we are going to achieve in this guide
We are going to create a Spring Boot project using Spring Data JPA together with Postgres and
implement a REST API endpoint to return all the customer details that are stored in the database.
Then we will test this API using the *Testcontainers* Postgres module and *RestAssured*.

== Getting Started
You can create a new Spring Boot project from https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] by selecting the *Spring Web*,
*Spring Data JPA*, *PostgreSQL Driver* and *Testcontainers* starters.

Instead, you can clone https://github.com/testcontainers/tc-guide-testing-spring-boot-rest-api.git repository
and switch to the *initial* branch.

If you have selected the *Maven* build tool you can see that the following Spring Boot starters
as well as the *Testcontainers* Postgres module dependencies are added to the *pom.xml*.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/pom.xml[lines="18..50,56"]
----

If you have selected the Gradle build tool instead, then the *build.gradle* file is configured with the selected dependencies.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/build.gradle[lines="22..32,34"]
----

Using the Testcontainers' *BOM* (Bill Of Material) is highly recommended so that you don't have to
repeat the Testcontainers version for every individual Testcontainers module dependency

== Create JPA entity
First let us start with creating a JPA entity *Customer.java*.

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/Customer.java[]
----

== Create Spring Data JPA repository
Spring Data JPA is an abstraction on top of JPA and provides basic CRUD operations,
sorting and pagination capabilities and dynamic query generation from method names.

Let us create a Spring Data JPA repository interface for the *Customer* entity.


[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerRepository.java[]
----

== Add schema creation script
As we are not using any in-memory database, we need to create the Postgres database tables by some means.
The recommended approach is to use some database migration tool like *Flyway* or *Liquibase*,
but for this guide we will use simple schema initialization support provided by Spring Boot.

Create a *schema.sql* file with the following content under the *src/main/resources* directory.

[source,sql]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/resources/schema.sql[]
----

We also need to enable schema initialization by adding the following property in
the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file.

[source,properties]
----
spring.sql.init.mode=always
----

== Create REST API endpoint
Finally, create a controller to implement a REST API endpoint to fetch all customers from the database.

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerController.java[]
----

== Write test for API endpoint
We are going to write a test for the REST API *GET /api/customers* endpoint by starting the Spring context
using the *@SpringBootTest* annotation and invoke the APIs using *RestAssured*.

First let us add the *rest-assured* library dependency.

If you are using *Maven* then add the following dependency in *pom.xml* file.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

If you are using *Gradle* build tool then add the following dependency in *build.gradle* file.

[source,groovy]
----
testImplementation 'io.rest-assured:rest-assured'
----

But in order to successfully start our Spring context we need a Postgres database up and running and
configure the context to talk to that database. This is where Testcontainers comes into the picture.

We can use the Testcontainers library to spin up a Postgres database instance as a Docker container and
configure the application to talk to that database as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/testcontainers/demo/CustomerControllerTest.java[]
----

Let us understand what is going on in this test.

* We have annotated the test class with the *@SpringBootTest* annotation together with the webEnvironment config, so that the test will run by starting the entire application on a random available port.
* We have created an instance of *PostgreSQLContainer* using the *postgres:16-alpine* Docker image. The Postgres container is started using JUnit 5 *@BeforeAll* callback method which gets executed before running any test method within a test instance.
* The Postgres database runs on port 5432 inside the container and maps to a random available port on the host.
* We have registered the database connection properties dynamically obtained from the Postgres container using Spring Boot's *DynamicPropertyRegistry*.
* We have injected the random port on which the Spring Boot application started using *@LocalServerPort* and registered the RestAssured *baseURI*.
* We are deleting all customer rows using JUnit 5 *@BeforeEach* callback method which gets executed before every test method. This will ensure the predictable data setup for every test and circumvent any kind of test pollution.
* Finally, in the *shouldGetAllCustomers()* test, we have initialized the test data and invoked the *GET /api/customers* API endpoint and verified that 2 customer records are returned from the API.

== Run tests

[source,shell]
----
# If you are using Maven
./mvnw test

# If you are using Gradle
./gradlew test
----

You should see the Postgres docker container is started and all tests should PASS.
You can also notice that after tests are executed the containers are stopped and removed automatically.

== Summary
The Testcontainers library helped us to write integration tests by using the same type of database, Postgres,
that we use in production as opposed to Mocks or in-memory databases.
As we are not using mocks and talking to the real services, we are free to do any code refactoring and
still ensure that the application is working as expected.
